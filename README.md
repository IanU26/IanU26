### Hi there - I'm IanðŸ‘‹
I am a recent UCLA graduate with a B.S. in physics. I am looking to enter the tech space as a software engineer. Here I practice writing code and post it as I learn more and more about computer science. I also have some repositories that include a bit of the work I did at UCLA in the areas of particle physics and coherent diffractive imaging. Feel free to reach out to me for anything related to my projects here!
