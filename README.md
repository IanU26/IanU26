### Hi there - I'm Ian<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
I am a grad student studying electrical engineering at SJSU with a B.S. in physics from UCLA. Here I practice writing code and post it as I learn. I also have some repositories that include a bit of the work I did at UCLA in the areas of particle physics and coherent diffractive imaging. Feel free to reach out to me for anything related to my projects here!
